metas.py - create the meta file that will configure a run

This was originally included in the run.py file, but has grown compliated
enough to warrent the creation of a fully separate management system

metas.emit produces a meta file that describes what we want a run to do: the
values of the z_line, lattice spacing, and actin permissiveness through the run
and where it will be stored after completion.

Example
--------
>>> freq, phase = 10, .8
>>> timetrace = metas.time(.1, 10)
>>> zline = metas.zline_workloop(1250, 25, freq, timetrace)
>>> activation = metas.actin_permissiveness_workloop(freq, phase, 10, 3, 3,
...  timetrace)
>>> metas.emit('./', None, timetrace, z_line=zline,
...  actin_permissiveness=activation, write=False, phase=phase, freq=freq)

    """Produce a structured JSON file that will be consumed to create a run

    Import emit into an interactive workspace and populate a directory with
    run configurations to be executed by a cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_local: string
        The local (absolute or relative) directory to which we save both
        emitted files and run output.
    path_s3: string
        The s3 bucket (and optional folder) to save run output to and to which
        the emitted files should be uploaded.
    time: iterable
        Time trace for run, in ms
    poisson: float
        poisson ratio of lattice. 0.5 const vol; 0 default const lattice;
        negative for auxetic
    ls: float, optional
        Specifies the initial starting lattice spacing which will act as a
        zero or offset for the spacing. If not given, the default lattice
        spacing from hs.hs will be used.
    z_line: float or iterable, optional
        If not given, default distance specified in hs.hs is used. If given as
        float, the z-line distance for the run. If given as an iterable, used as
        trace for run, timestep by timestep.
    actin_permissiveness: float or iterable, optional
        Same as for z-line.
    comment: string, optional
        Space for comment on the purpose or other characteristics of the run
    write: bool, optional
        True (default) writes file to path_local/name.meta.json. Other values
        don't. In both cases the dictionary describing the run is returned.
    **kwargs:
        Further keyword args will be included in the output dictionary. These
        are used to sort the resulting runs by their properties of interest.
        For example, where we are varying phase of activation across a series
        of runs we would include the argument, e.g. 'phase=0.2', in order to
        sort over phase when looking at results.

        Copy of run dictionary saved to disk as json.
